In this, you can add data into a database that will store all of the information about products, category, etc. You can then use HTTP methods to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE different data and manipulate the data as you wish.    ## Installation   Go to the GitHub link that is provided in this README. Then, click on it and navigate to the page. Once there, click on the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTP or SSH url that is given. Go to Visual Studio Code, and clone the project onto your local machine.   ## Usage   First, you go to the server.js file, right click on it, and open it in the integrated terminal. There you can run the command 'nodemon server.js', and the server will begin running. Afterwards, open another terminal, and run the schema.sql file in the mysql terminal. After that, exit to the regular terminal, and run the 'npm run seed' command to populate data into the database. Once done, you can test the api routes that are listed in the 'api' folder. (Note: make sure to create a '.env' file that contains the database name, username, and password for mysql. Ex: DB_NAME: ' databaseName', DB_USER = 'root', DB_PASSWORD: 'password'. Then, remove '.env' from the .gitignore file.)   ## Contributions   If there are any questions or suggestions to change the project, please send them to the email that is provided below!!   ## Testing   There are currently no tests being done for this application!!   ## Licenses   License: MIT     ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)   https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT   ## Questions   Have questions about this project?
